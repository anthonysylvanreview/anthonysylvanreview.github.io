| Nov 27 | Excavation work begins. |
| Nov 30 | *Verizon line accidentally cut by excavation crew*. |
| Nov 30 | Excavation crew buried trunks of several mature trees below site up to 3'. Arborist who I consulted said that this would endanger the trees, especially over winter with freezing. I notified Sales Guy. |

| Dec 5 | Steel crew onsite setting rebar frame for pool. |
| Dec 20 | Plumbing work done. Filter set in place. Concerned about height / closeness to pool of filter equipment, since it's quite messy. Project Manager comes out to site, agrees to have it lowered if needed. (I ended up getting the fence builder to block it off). *Plumbers forgot to run the line to the waterfall.* |

| Jan 2 | Salt system installed. |
| Jan 6 | Project Manager says he's contacted excavation crew about tree dig-out. |
| Feb 23 | Project Manager says he'll contact excavation crew tomorrow about dig-out. Also "itâ€™s been crazy mild. We should be ramping up soon because of the mild weather." |
| Mar 9 | Electrical line run. Electricians unable to move breakers between subpanels, so I pay my regular electrician $300 to do so.  Takes him 30m. Project Manager says "excavator should be out shortly." |
| Mar 13 | Excavator comes and digs out dirt around trees. |
| Mar 16 | (we hadn't had frost for 2 weeks) I emailed Project Manager suggesting the lockdown was about to happen. He said crews were working at full speed. |
| Mar 18 | Project Manager says we're "nearing top of the list". |

| Apr 15 | Project Manager says "date hasn't been set yet". |
| Apr 17 | Project Manager says "at least 10-14 days out". |
| Apr 21 | One of the large oaks that had its trunk buried over winter fails to leaf out. I have it removed. Tree crew finds rot. (Possibly unrelated). |
| April 28 | Project Manager predicts deck "formed and inspected by 2nd week of May, completed 3rd week if not sooner". |
| April 29 | _Work resumes_ - stone facing work is done. NOTE - Sales Guy had promised *completion* in April during the sales pitch, and that we'd be right at the head of the queue for spring construction. |
| May 13 | After nothing happens for 2 weeks, I email Sales Guy and ask him to step in to assist on Project Management, since Project Manager is unable to keep project moving (and, there have been several snafus otherwise up to this point). | 
| May 16 | I follow up on my email to Sales Guy, since I hadn't received a reply. |
| May 17 | Sales Guy replies, briefly saying he's referring me to "his" Construction Manager. |
| May 18 | Project Manager walks the site to check out progress. Misses that the deck dimensions as enclosed by retaining walls are 3' wider in one direction than they should be. Misses that waterfall plumbing wasn't done. Project Manager also states that "he's not a numbers guy", and doesn't know how to calculate linear feet of steps that are on the plan. |
| May 18 | Patio Subcontractor Chief comes on site to check out the project, and informs me that main stairs to patio were not priced in. I email Sales Guy asking for a call, since I'm unable to reach him by phone. (He was the one who drew up the scope of work for the retaining wall subcontractor, who Patio Subcontractor Chief says should have built the stairs.) | 
| May 18 | I measure deck, notice discrepency in dimensions (mentioned above), email Project Manager and Sales Guy asking for "design change" so that paths along the sides can be accomodated given new dimensions. |
| May 21 | Sales Guy replies saying "it has been busier than I can ever remember", and doesn't acknowledge details of dimensions issue. |
| May 22 | Patio Subcontractor Chief comes out, acknowledges that dimensions are wrong. Proposes $4430 upcharge for stairs and drain, neither of which were priced in. |
| May 22 | I email Sales Guy and Project Manager again with summary, asking for response. Sales Guy replies saying he will talk to Patio Subcontractor Chief and that we should talk May 26. I confirm, asking him to propose a time. | 
| May 26 | I call Sales Guy, get voicemail, then I email asking what time he'd like to talk. |
| May 28 | Patio Subcontractor Admin calls, asking whether I will pay upcharge. |
| May 28 | I call Sales Guy, finally get him. He spends 45 minutes blaming Retaining Wall Subcontractor, and accepts no responsibility, and will pick up none of the upcharge. | 
| May 29 | I talk to Patio Subcontractor Admin, pay upcharge. |
| Jun 12 | Patio work begins. |
| Jun 15 | Because of the dimensions issue observed/reported May 18, deck crew goes off-script and builds awkward deck transition, stairs at varying widths. I email Sales Guy and Project Manager photos in early evening, after doing a site walk through. |
| Jun 16 | After receiving no response from either, I escalate to CEO by email. |
| Jun 16 | Construction Manager calls me (first conversation with him), apologizes. Project Manager and Patio Subcontractor Chief will be sent out. |
| Jun 16 | Patio Subcontractor Chief arrives, observes issue, says fixing path widths will be extra upcharge. I call Construction Manager, who agrees to pick up this tab, since it was clearly their mistake. |
| Jun 19 | Project Manager comes to site for first time in over a month. | 
| Jun 19 | Project Manager sends me Pre-Plaster Walkthrough document for signature. | 
| Jun 27 | I contact CEO again about path subsidence, path edging failing, etc. | 
| Jun 29 | Construction Manager emails and says he will send out Patio Subcontractor Chief & crew tomorrow. |
| Jun 30 | Patio Subcontractor Chief comes on site, inspects, will send crew following week. | 
| Jul 1 | Plaster Crew on site, does plastering. Water scheduled for same day, but doesn't arrive. |
| Jul 2 | 2 Water Trucks arrive at 9AM, start filling pool. One water driver decides she doesn't like our driveway (steep) and refuses to do any more runs. Remaining 4 runs to be done by single driver. Driver breaks down between 3rd and 4th run, leaving additional 5 hour period before pool is filled. Last fill finishes 9PM. Several inches below tiles, so I leave hose on overnight to complete fill. |
| Jul 2 | I email Construction Manager expressing concern at plaster blotchiness / dirt / seepage. Also request he do site visit. | 
| Jul 2 | Pool Startup Guy on site, starts up pool, does "Pool School". |
| Jul 2 | Pool Cover Guy on site, measures for cover. |
| Jul 6 | Patio Construction Chief, Crew, and Construction Manager come on-site. Agree to subsidence and path edge remediation. Crew does remediation. Constructio Manager promises "free pool closing" at end of season as compensation. | 
| Jul 9 | Plaster Crew comes on site, inspects, do some work and leave without telling me what they did. Ph is below 6 when I test so I assume it's an acid bath. I email Construction Manager asking him to find out what they did. | 
| Jul 10 | Construction Manager replies saying Plaster Crew did only "spot treatments", and I can restore pool chemistry with baking soda. | 
| Jul 11 | Plaster Crew Owners come on site, decide an acid bath is immediately needed. | 
| Jul 13 | I notice leak in plumbing to Polaris Pump, notify Construction Manager. Also notice shallow end light is half full of water, notify Construction Manager. |
| Jul 13 | Plaster Crew comes out, begins acid bath. |
| Jul 15 | Scheduler sends out Electricians to fix light. Unfortunately acid bath is in progress, so they can't access it. | 
| Jul 17 | Project Manager comes out in attempt to fix Polaris plumbing. Doesn't have parts, says he will return Jul 20. |
| Jul 17 | Plaster Crew comes out, disassembles acid bath, restores chemistry. |
| Jul 22 | I email Project Manager, Construction Manager asking when he will return to fix plumbing. | 
| Jul 23 | Project Manager comes out, "fixes" plumbing. Polaris not functional (moving) shortly after he leaves. | 
| Jul 24 | Project Manager comes back out, fixes Polaris (pebble jammed in mechanism). | 
| Jul 30 | Polaris plumbing springs major leak overnight, pool loses 1000 gallons. I report this to Construction Manager and Project Manager. |
| Jul 30 | Project Manager comes out, determines that the screw fitting for Polaris plumbing is damaged. | 
| Aug 3 | Patio Construction Chief comes on site, agrees to rebuild steps where mortar is cracking and not aligned at 90 degrees. Says probably end of week for crew. | 
| Aug 3 | Electricians come out, replace shallow end light. Fail to attach it to pool wall, so it floats in pool. I report to Construction Manager. |
| Aug 4 | Salt system startup is done. | 
| Aug 7 | Plumber comes out, replaces Polaris pump. |
| Aug 7 | Electricians come out, properly attach light to pool wall. | 
| Aug 11 | Pool Cover Guy calls, says the style of cover we wanted isn't warrantied. Offers waiver, or different style. I email with Construction Manager and opt for waiver. | 
| Aug 11 | I email Construction Manager asking him to find out Patio Crew schedule. |
