# Timeline

The following is a start to finish timeline of the project. Some of the dates are approximate, as the dates are reconstructed from email. I've linked to appropriate issues from the timeline below.


| Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Notes | 
|-----------|---|
| Aug 13 | Initial sales meeting |
| Sep 10 | Design meeting |
| Sep 23 | "Meet & Greet" meeting - Project Manager intro | 
| Sep 23 | County requires Geotech report to build | 
| Sep 28 | Deposit paid ($10k) | 
| Oct 23 | Geotech report done (required by permitting) |
| Nov 6 | County permit issued | 
| Nov 12 | Addendum #2 sent for extra bond beam height | 
| Nov 18 | Addendum #3 sent to steps around pool, extra 240 sq ft pavers, per design |
| Nov 18 | Payment #1 paid ($34,306)
| Nov 27 | Excavation work begins |
| Nov 30 | *Verizon line accidentally cut by excavation crew* |
| Nov 30 | Excavation crew buried trunks of several mature trees below site up to 3'. Arborist who I consulted said that this would endanger the trees, especially over winter with freezing. I notified Sales Guy. |
| Nov 30 | Payment #1.5 - extra amount of $4,714 | 
| Dec 2 | Project Manager replies about trees, saying that excavation crew will come out to fix. |
| Dec 5 | Steel crew onsite setting rebar frame for pool. |
| Dec 20 | Plumbing work done. Filter set in place. Concerned about height / closeness to pool of filter equipment, since it's quite messy. Project Manager comes out to site, agrees to have it lowered if needed. (I ended up getting the fence builder to block it off). *Plumbers forgot to run the line to the waterfall.* |
| Dec 27 | Payment #2 paid ($50049). | 
| Dec 28 | Gunnite sprayed, site shut down for winter. |
| Jan 2 | Salt system installed. |
| Jan 6 | Project Manager says he's contacted excavation crew about tree dig-out. |
| Feb 23 | Project Manager says he'll contact excavation crew tomorrow about dig-out. Also "itâ€™s been crazy mild. We should be ramping up soon because of the mild weather." |
| Mar 9 | Electrical line run. Electricians unable to move breakers between subpanels, so I pay my regular electrician $300 to do so.  Takes him 30m. Project Manager says "excavator should be out shortly." |
| Mar 13 | Excavator comes and digs out dirt around trees. |
| Mar 16 | (we hadn't had frost for 2 weeks) I emailed Project Manager suggesting the lockdown was about to happen. He said crews were working at full speed. |
| Mar 18 | Project Manager says we're "nearing top of the list". |
| Mar 25 | Payment #2.5 - ($501). | 
| Mar 30 | Project Manager says "a week or so" (per Scheduler). |
| Apr 8 | Project Manager says "early next week". |
| Apr 15 | Project Manager says "date hasn't been set yet". |
| Apr 17 | Project Manager says "at least 10-14 days out". |
| Apr 21 | One of the large oaks that had its trunk buried over winter fails to leaf out. I have it removed. Tree crew finds rot. (Possibly unrelated). |
| April 28 | Project Manager predicts deck "formed and inspected by 2nd week of May, completed 3rd week if not sooner". |
| April 29 | Work resumes. NOTE - Sales Guy had promised *completion* in April during the sales pitch, and that we'd be right at the head of the queue for spring construction. |
|      | TODO remaining |
