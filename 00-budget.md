# Budget

We were very clear that our top budget was $125,000, and Sales Guy [agreed](./02-thesale.html) to work to this. In the end we spent $147,000 total to get the pool up and running.

Here's the budget. "AS" here indicates payment to Anthony Sylvan. All other payments were to other contractors, some of whom were Anthony Sylvan subcontractors.

## Payment Schedule

Anthony Sylvan has an aggressive payment schedule - 95% is due before the Gunnite is even poured. This leaves you very little negotiating room, and incentivizes Anthony Sylvan to stack up customers and knock out the first half of the build only. You'll see in [the timeline](./01-timeline.html) that Gunnite was complete within a month of the build starting, leaving another seven months before the pool was swimmable.
