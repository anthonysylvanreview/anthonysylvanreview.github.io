# Coping Not Watertight

After 4" of rain over a couple of days, the water level in the pool rose to just above the tile line. Cleaning up the next morning, I noticed that there was a steady trickle of water coming through the stonework on the raised beams and steps in several places. I emailed Construction Manager about it, and he said that that was normal since the coping joint wasn't intended to be watertight. I drained a few inches off and indeed the trickle stopped.

I was skeptical about this, and posted the videos in a pool forum online. I got multiple responses saying that their pools (or pools they built) had coping sealed with watertight grout. I asked Construction Manager again, and he said "As far as the grout goes we build all of our pool to industry standards. If you are referring to the grout under the coping the water should never go above the tile line. The tile and the plaster is the seal not the thin set under the coping."
