# Summary

Anthony & Sylvan may have been a great company at one point, but based upon our experience having a pool built by them, my opinion is that they've prioritized profit over quality.

## Project Management

The biggest issue I believe is lack of company project management. There is a "Project Manager" role, but it is not the "construction project management" role that Sales Guy asserted it was. Project Manager was on-site maybe 10 times total over the course of the project, and 3 of those were to try to fix the polaris plumbing. He may have overlapped with subcontracting crews a couple of times, but he never gave direction. Talking about some construction/plan details, he was out of his depth and deferred back to Sales Guy or to Construction Manager. I don't think any of this was his fault - the role of Project Manager at Anthony & Sylvan doesn't seem to be set up as it should be.

Most of the issues we encountered should have been caught by a project manager, onsite with the crews. None of them were. There were perhaps 15 actual construction days over the 11 months of the project; if you assume a project manager makes $75/hr, and would be onsite 2 hours of each of those 15 days in this theoretical new role, that would cost Anthony & Sylvan $2,250 out of the project. Heck, double that for the sake of travel, and it's still less than $5k. A minor amount in a $147k job, and if it assures that customers don't end up giving 2 star reviews, then worth it.

The project manager should be empowered to be the customer's biggest advocate. They should be in the planning process from the start, rather than having the project dumped on them once gunnite is done. They should try to match or exceed the [renders](./06-diverock.html) that the customer is presented with (bearing in mind that customers aren't construction people, and can't visualize details from plans.)

## Quality

There were many many mistakes over the course of the project. The subcontracting crews were on their own, with no quality control on site. Many were skilled tradesmen, but because of lack of on site oversight, made and left mistakes in place. 

The inefficiency of ordering two [batches of stone](./19-stonework.html), and having two masons, deserves repeat mention here. Anthony & Sylvan is so focused on verticalized subcontractors that they fail to see the cross-cutting aspects of the job. Different subcontracting crews were never onsite at the same time, and were never working together. There was potential for that to happen at multiple phases in the project. It would have improved things.  

Some of the vendors were just not very good (e.g. the water company, using 1970s trucks.)

## Overall

Avoid Anthony & Sylvan for your pool build. They will nickel and dime you whereever possible. You will be the project management they that don't supply. If you miss quality issues, my opinion is that they won't rectify them. And they're _expensive_ - charging a premum price is fine if the product is premium, but theirs is not. You can do better.
