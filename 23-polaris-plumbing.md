# Polaris Plumbing

I noticed a leak in the plumbing to the Polaris Pump, and notified Construction Manager on July 17. It took until August 7 to resolve the issue. In the meantime the pool lost 1000 gallons. See details in [the timeline](./01-timeline.html) (scroll down to July 17 to pick up the story).
