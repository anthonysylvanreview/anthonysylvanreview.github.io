# The People Involved

To preserve anonymity of employees and subcontractors, I'm referring to people involved by their titles. Here's the cast of characters:

* Sales Guy - handled initial sale. Gave specs to core subcontractors. Handled project management up until Gunnite.
* Project Manager - occasionally checked boxes. Attempt at plumbing repair.
* Patio Subcontractor Chief - frequently onsite because of his crew's mistakes. Upcharged for stairs/drain.
* Patio Crew - made many mistakes.
