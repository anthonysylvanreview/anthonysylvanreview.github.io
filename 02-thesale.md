# The Sale

I engaged with Anthony Sylvan after working with a bio-pool company to try to come up with plans that would work (because of too many compromises in the proposed construction - steel walls, fiberglass liner - I ended up backing out of that before signing a contract.)

I met with Sales Guy 3 times - the Initial Sale, the Design Meeting, and the Meet & Greet.

## Initial Sale

In the first meeting (Aug 13), he:

* agreed to work with our top budget of $125k ("no problem")
* said that while they do use subcontractors for the actual work (an area of concern for me) that their project management would be managing all the details of the build, and would be on site with subcontractors
* agreed that the dive rock would be one of the large rocks we looked at on site (we live on a mountain; we have plenty of large rocks)
* said that the build would be completed by end of April

None of these things ended up being true. Surely he had to know that at least the project management statement was incorrect; I suspect he also knew that the budget and timeline were a stretch.

We walked through the line items of the budget in a great deal of detail during this meeting.

## Design Meeting

On the second meeting (Sep 10), he: 

* presented plans which contained elements that would have blown the budget (pergola, fire pit, stairs from driveway to patio, stone pavers embedded in driveway to gate)

Whether this was conscious or not, it caused later issues.

## Meet & Greet

I don't have notes from this meeting (Sep 23).
