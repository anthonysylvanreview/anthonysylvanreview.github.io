# Anthony Sylvan Pools Review

We spent $140,000 to get a pool built by Anthony Sylvan. It has taken 11 months, and there are still unresolved issues. They sent an email asking for a review, so I figured I'd write a public review going through the build from start to finish.

Overall I would give them 2/5. The end result is pretty good, but the process was a nightmare, and the company is disorganized and cares much more about saving money than delivering a quality result. If you're going to build a pool, find a local pool builder with good reviews and use them instead.
