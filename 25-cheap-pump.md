# Cheap Pump

Anthony & Sylvan apparently prefer to install cheap, fixed speed pumps. Our pump (Jandy Pro PHP 1.5 HP - $401 retail) is so noisy that we don't run it while using the pool - it instead runs the filters overnight. This means that we never take advantage of the waterfall feature when using the pool during the day.

Comment from an online forum about this: "Brand new install and you didn't get VS? You got hosed, bro."

A good variable speed pump for this pool size is apparently the IntelliFlo 3HP ($999 retail).

Anthony & Sylvan chose to save $600 on a luxury pool build, disregarding the lifetime aesthetics of using the pool.
